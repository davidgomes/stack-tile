# Stack Tile #
Stack Tile is a 2D maze puzzle game where the player (a whie square) needs to get to the flag by walking through several doors.

There are, however, many types of doors, and each type of door can only be opened with a certain key. So, for example, a red door can only be opened with a red key.

Additionally, the player can only use the last key grabbed. So, there is a stack of keys - when the player catches a key, it is put on top of the stack and this is the only key which can be used.

After the player opens a door, it is only open for about 2 seconds.

## Controls ##
-WASD or the arrow keys to move.
-R to restart level
-ESC to go back to the title screen

## Hardcore Mode ##
There are 6 normal levels and 3 hardcore levels. On the last 3 levels, the player does not know what the stack currently looks like.

## Technology ##
Stack Tile was made using the programming language Lua, along with the really awesome 2D Game Development Library LÃ–VE.
